                                    HEMLIBRA is indicated for routine

                                    VIII inhibitors. HEMLIBRA has a Boxed

                                    thromboembolism. Cases of thrombotic
                                    microangiopathy and thrombotic events were
                                    reported when on average a cumulative amount
                                    of over 100 units per kilogram per day of
                                    activated prothrombin complex concentrate,
                                    aPCC, was administered for 24 hours or more
                                    to patients receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis.

                                    So, today's question is one I've heard
                                    before. Factor Replacement Therapy is tried
                                    and true. So, why wouldn't I continue to use
                                    that in most of my patients with hemophilia
                                    A and just reserve HEMLIBRA for those
                                    specific types of patients where Factor
                                    isn't working well. Usually that's someone
                                    with venous access issues or someone with
                                    Factor VIII inhibitors or someone who's

                                    chat a little bit about your opinion, at

                                    We were a little bit hesitant to switch
                                    everybody who had hemophilia without
                                    inhibitors to HEMLIBRA. The patients that we
                                    thought were most ideal to start with were
                                    patients that had difficulty in venous
                                    access.

                                    There was initial concern with the TMA, the
                                    thrombotic microangiopathy and the
                                    thrombosis that were worrisome to some
                                    physicians including me. But as our
                                    experience grew, we understood that TMA was
                                    only because of a certain association with
                                    the PCC, the prothrombin complex

                                    Our experience grew with other patients, so
                                    we became more comfortable. We expanded our
                                    use of HEMLIBRA to other patients with
                                    hemophilia A without inhibitors. One
                                    particular example that I can think of is a
                                    family that had two boys, siblings, with
                                    hemophilia A, that I offered the therapy to.
                                    They were treating bleeds off and on
                                    throughout the year intravenously through a
                                    peripheral vein and I offered the therapy to
                                    them. However, we were able to move to once
                                    every four weeks therapy with HEMLIBRA. And
                                    that change was amazing for the boys, both
                                    of them. They were no longer trying to find
                                    veins in their busy school schedules. So
                                    they were, not only they but their mom was
                                    also very happy with the change.

                                    every four weeks. HAVEN 3 included adults
                                    and adolescents without inhibitors and HAVEN
                                    4 included adults and adolescents with or
                                    without inhibitors.

                                    different age groups, different severities,

                                    bleeding disorders and one of my campers was
                                    using this medicine and I was like, wow, you
                                    know, looks like a sub-Q injection. I have
                                    never seen anything like that for hemophilia
                                    treatment ever. So I was kind of just blown
                                    away because he was like, &quot;Yeah, I do
                                    it once a week.&quot; And I was like,
                                    &quot;Once a week?&quot; And it's not even
                                    taking him that long. You know, I
                                    went—immediately I got back from camp and I
                                    went to go speak to my doctor and I was
                                    like, &quot;Can we possibly talk about

                                    were all amazed at how a change in therapy

                                    with your hemophilia treatment, you know.
                                    It's one of those things that you have to
                                    learn to evolve and grow in different times

                                    These three perspectives really painted a
                                    picture. While Sanjay and Courtney began
                                    with those obvious types of patients, those
                                    with inhibitors, and of course those with
                                    venous access issues, but both of their
                                    perspectives shifted after seeing the
                                    reduction in bleeds needing treatment in
                                    those patients and how well the dosing and
                                    administration aspect fit into their lives.

                                    As for Louis, he didn't have any major
                                    issues with his current therapy. He simply
                                    wanted to take advantage of something that
                                    he believed could help him maintain a

                                    see HEMLIBRA as a backup treatment option

                                    So, to answer the question we came here for,
                                    why expand your use of HEMLIBRA outside of
                                    the obvious cases, well, from what we've
                                    heard, HEMLIBRA raises the bar in terms of
                                    bleed protection and allows many patients to
                                    go from infusing multiple times a week to a
                                    subcutaneous injection once a week, once
                                    every two weeks or once every four weeks.
                                    So, why not offer that to more patients? It
                                    may impact them more than you realize. If
                                    you have a tough question about HEMLIBRA,

                                    Today's question is a tricky one. If a
                                    patient is well-controlled on their current
                                    therapy, why would I switch them to
                                    HEMLIBRA, especially if they didn't ask to
                                    switch? I sent this question out to
                                    different treaters in the hemophilia A
                                    community and people with hemophilia and got
                                    some interesting responses back. Seems like
                                    different people have different definitions
                                    of well controlled. I'm going to speak to a
                                    few of these people and dig a little deeper
                                    into their thoughts on this topic.

                                    All right. Hi there, Erin. It is great to
                                    see you.

                                    How do you define well-controlled when you
                                    think about patients with hemophilia A?

                                    My thought of well-controlled is kind of an
                                    all around picture, not just their number of
                                    treated bleeds that they've been
                                    experiencing or the lack thereof, but also
                                    how they're feeling about their care.
                                    Patients may think, oh, I have one treated
                                    bleed per month. That's good for me. Whereas
                                    as treaters we're thinking, no, it needs to
                                    be better than that.

                                    I personally define well-controlled as
                                    having less than three bleeds requiring
                                    treatment per year, but you did bring up a
                                    good point, how there really is no standard
                                    definition for what well controlled means.
                                    So I think there definitely is a discrepancy
                                    between patients and providers and what
                                    patients think is well controlled versus
                                    what is actually happening in reality.

                                    therapies that are available, that you
                                    probably think this is a kind of patient
                                    that they feel like they're doing well, you
                                    don't want to rock the boat, you know, in
                                    terms of offering them any new therapies or
                                    suggesting any changes, then how do you
                                    provide those details in terms of how you
                                    think it could help, you know, that

                                    agent and it works differently from prior
                                    therapies and that it has a much longer
                                    half-life. And so we're able to achieve this
                                    steady state of drug in their body.

                                    rundown of the pivotal trial data. In HAVEN
                                    3 and HAVEN 4, most patients taking HEMLIBRA
                                    had zero bleeds requiring treatment,
                                    regardless of whether HEMLIBRA was taken
                                    once a week, once every two weeks, or once
                                    every four weeks. HAVEN 3 included adults
                                    and adolescents without inhibitors and HAVEN
                                    4 included adults and adolescents with or
                                    without inhibitors. The HAVEN 3 study of
                                    people without inhibitors included an
                                    intra-patient comparison of people who were
                                    on factor VIII prophylaxis for at least 24
                                    weeks. The study found that those who
                                    switched to HEMLIBRA had 68% fewer treated
                                    bleeds over a medium period of 34 weeks.

                                    and they felt that they were well
                                    controlled, but as you were digging a little
                                    deeper, you actually discovered, well,
                                    things are not really fine?

                                    of contact that these patients are having,
                                    the more information and more interesting

                                    picture of how the patient's doing.
                                    Sometimes they may feel more comfortable
                                    sharing with the social worker than with
                                    another member of our team. So they may get

                                    so in that regard, we kind of put all the

                                    this has happened, where I’ll have a patient
                                    tell me that he's well controlled, only
                                    having a couple bleeds a year, but once
                                    switching to HEMLIBRA, they'll realize how
                                    much control they're having over their
                                    bleeding symptoms and reporting not having
                                    to use any factor replacement in the past
                                    six months.

                                    So I think the ease of administration is

                                    comfort level that comes with that.
                                    Obviously, as we have more and more patients
                                    on it, we still have a lot to learn. But now
                                    that we've had it available for as long as
                                    it's been out, then we've developed that
                                    comfort level with it.

                                    There are a lot of layers to this question.
                                    First, we discovered that there's no real
                                    definition of well controlled. While some
                                    may say a few treated bleeds a year is okay,
                                    a parent may feel that every single bleed or
                                    every single infusion is a very big deal.

                                    they're doing well enough, but if they're

                                    always mixed feelings. Our patients in the

                                    concerns mainly because HEMLIBRA is a novel

                                    you know, there was very nice and good open
                                    communication among the hemophilia and

                                    a great routine before HEMLIBRA, right, but
                                    it sounds like you were pretty structured
                                    and comfortable, would you say?

                                    switched over to HEMLIBRA and I had a pretty

                                    you hear about HEMLIBRA for the first time?

                                    products all the time, and she's very up to
                                    date on everything. And me obviously being
                                    very rebellious, I kind of just shrugged her
                                    off and blew it off, to be honest with you.
                                    I was just very skeptical. I was very
                                    comfortable in my routine. And honestly, I
                                    was just not really open to changing that

                                    right? That skepticism, that anxiety. What
                                    was it for you in particular, like focusing
                                    on that skepticism, do you think that sort

                                                fetal harm when administered to

                                                should be used during pregnancy

                                                for the mother outweighs the
